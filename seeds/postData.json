However, less JavaScript is required to make your site load fast. As a developer, you will always be crushed in the middle trying to strike a balance between the two. What if I told you that you could write as much JavaScript as you want â€” gigabytes of it â€” and still not worry about your app's performance? What if I told you that every prominent web framework you have used up to this point is fundamentally flawed by design? They expect you to act in a way that will make your life difficult. JavaScript is inevitable."

We have seen an overall decrease on interest in crypto and NFTs. At least that's what Google says. Overall trend is going down for both. For crypto as we can see below, there was a spike of interest ðŸ“ˆ on May this year, all this because of the Luna fall which we covered in our previous newsletter. While interest in NFTs is pretty much at the same level it was early October last year."
